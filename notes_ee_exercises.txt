* Random walk to Brownian motion

Brownian motion is the continuous-time limit of the random walk. Start with a random walk that moves, in each time step, with equal probability either a+bx or a-bx.

In the long-time limit, what are the parameters of the Brownian motion to which this random walk converges?

* Prove that the variance of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of the variances of the variables.

Recall that two random variables X and Y are independent if <XY>=<X><Y>.

* Prove that the variance of a standard random walk (moving +1 or -1 in each time step) is the number of time steps.
How are the dimensions of time related to the dimensions of this variance?

* Simulate 1,000 steps of a standard random walk, and plot its finite-time average.

* Prove that the finite-time average of the Wiener process is distributed as N(0,T/3).

* (Gaussian Central Limit Theorem) Prove that the rescaled sum, 1/sqrt{N} \sum_\tau^T x_\tau, of independent instances x_\tau of a random variable X converges to a Gaussian, provided the variance of X exists.

* Prove Ito's formula

* Prove that RGBM has an inverse-gamma stationary distribution for sufficiently large \tau. 
What does it mean to be stationary for a distribution whose variance doesn't exist?
What does it mean to be stationary for a distribution some of whose averages don't exist?

* Compute the expectation value of a log-normal random variable.

* Show that the expectation value of
1. the St Petersburg payout; and
2. Z such that p(z)=1/z^2 for z\geq1
do not exist.

* Show that the law of large numbers holds for continuous random variables under the frequentist interpretation of probability.

* find the median and variance of a GBM.
