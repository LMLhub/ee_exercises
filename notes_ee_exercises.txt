* Random walk to Brownian motion

Brownian motion is the continuous-time limit of the random walk. Start with a random walk that moves, in each time step, with equal probability either a+bx or a-bx.

In the long-time limit, what are the parameters of the Brownian motion to which this random walk converges?

* Prove that the variance of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of the variances of the variables.

Recall that two random variables X and Y are independent if <XY>=<X><Y>.

* Prove that the variance of a standard random walk (moving +1 or -1 in each time step) is the number of time steps.
How are the dimensions of time related to the dimensions of this variance?

* Simulate 1,000 steps of a standard random walk, and plot its finite-time average.

* Prove that the finite-time average of the Wiener process is distributed as N(0,T/3).
(harder)

* (Gaussian Central Limit Theorem) Prove that the rescaled sum, 1/sqrt{N} \sum_\tau^T x_\tau, of independent instances x_\tau of a random variable X converges to a Gaussian, provided the variance of X exists.

* Prove Ito's formula

* Prove Eq.45 in "The sum of log-normal variates in geometric Brownian motion" (PetersAdamou2018).

* Prove that RGBM has an inverse-gamma stationary distribution for sufficiently large \tau. 
What does it mean to be stationary for a distribution whose variance doesn't exist?
What does it mean to be stationary for a distribution some of whose averages don't exist?

* Compute the expectation value of a log-normal random variable.

* Show that the expectation value of
1. the St Petersburg payout; and
2. Z such that p(z)=1/z^2 for z\geq1
do not exist.

* Show that the law of large numbers holds for continuous random variables under the frequentist interpretation of probability.

* find the median and variance of a GBM.

* the fund manager detection problem: assume GBM for a stock market, and for a managed portfolio. How much outperformance, over how long, do you need for the probability of it being chance to be at most 5%?
Extra question: what if market and portfolio are correlated?

* assume you're tossing a fair coin once a millisecond to receive either nothing or two millicents.
After a day, what's the distribution of money you've won?
How does it compare to winning one millicent every millisecond (the expectation value).

* simulate a power-law distributed random variable whose variance doesn't exist. Measure the sample-variance and study its sample-size dependence.

* Give people data for several GBMs and one time series of stock-market returns. Let them find the stock market one, and offer a prize.

* Real pollen position data, model it with BM, see the differences (ballistic for short time etc).

* stock market data, find optimal leverage. Do the same for simulated data, with known sigma and mu and note that optimal leverage will not be exactly mu_e/sigma^2.

* verify that the rate of change of the inverse rate-one process is the growth rate. Try different values for gamma.

* solve the SDE 
d lnx = mu dt + sigma dW
Find the expectation value of x (to note: there's a +1/2 sigma^2 correction).

* find optimal leverage for the Cramer dynamic.

* derive results for cooperation by idiosyncratic entities and with correlated fluctuations.
